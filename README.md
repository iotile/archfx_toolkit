Sample scripts leveraging the ArchFX Platform APIs.

ðŸ“š **API Reference (Swagger UI)**

[https://{{tenant_name}}.archfx.io/api/docs/#/](https://{{tenant_name}}.archfx.io/api/docs/#/) <br><br>
Don't know your tenant name? Reach out to support because you're going to need that for everything. Similiarly, you must have username and password access to Arch. SSO won't work here.


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

The best way to get started is to run the `authenticate.py` script.

```bash
python3 authenticate.py
```

If this runs successfully: You're authenticated!<br>
âœ… You have valid credentials<br>
âœ… You can now make all kinds of API requests using the access_token.
